## Overview

<img src="figures/r_logo.png" width=50 align="left" />

This model document describes a procedure for quantifying benefits associated with removal of organism movement barriers within a watershed (e.g., dam removal, culvert repair, fish ladder installation) or impacts of barrier addition (e.g., dam construction, weir installation). The model focuses on upstream movement of migratory organisms such as fish and is intended for application at the watershed-scale.The algorithm is based on four primary components: habitat quantity upstream of a dam, habitat quality upstream of a dam, the passability of a structure for a given organism, and the shape/topology of the watershed. This algorithm combines these data to estimate quality-weighted, accessible habitat at the watershed scale. This model documentation is intented for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) model certification process and details the development, technical details, and application of this adaptable modeling framework.
